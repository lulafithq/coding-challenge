# HelloJoy Coding Challenge

In order to help us judge the technical capabilities of our candidates, we ask everyone to do a short coding exercise. We currently have two challenges for candidates can choose from:
- [Backend](https://github.com/hellojoyhq/coding-challenge/blob/master/backend-challenge.md)
- [Frontend](https://github.com/hellojoyhq/coding-challenge/blob/master/frontend-challenge.md)

You will find challenge-specific instructions within each of the above links. Remember, we're not expecting you to create a perfect solution. The challenges are intentionally limited and meant to give us insight into how you think, how you code, and how you communicate a solution to a problem.

If you have any questions, feel free to reach out to us directly!
